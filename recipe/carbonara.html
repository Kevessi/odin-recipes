    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      Carbonara is a classic Roman pasta dish that brings together simple yet
      luxurious ingredients like eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, pancetta, and
      black pepper. Whether born from the ingenuity of World War II soldiers or
      the traditional recipes of Roman shepherds, this dish is a culinary icon
      that celebrates the magic of a few quality ingredients. No cream, onions,
      or garlicâ€”just straightforward, hearty Italian cooking.

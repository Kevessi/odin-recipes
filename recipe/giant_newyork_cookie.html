    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      The Giant New York-Style Cookie is an indulgent treat that's crispy on the
      edges, yet chewy and gooey in the middle. Bursting with chocolate chips,
      this cookie is a true homage to the classic American dessert.

      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden but the center is
